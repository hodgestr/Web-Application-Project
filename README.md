# Web-Application-Project
# This project consists of 3 files - .js, .html and a .CSS file.
# I used pgAdmin for my database
# For my own memory-refresher purposes, I am pasting the project details below from the assignment page in my school's Canvas page:



This assignment is first step in getting the final assignment done for this class. Remember the structure of a web application - we have two main components:

    The server. Most in the class (including me) call this JavaScript code file 'contactsserver.js'. This code sets up the express server, listening on port 3500 (or 3000 which is the default for express), and sets up the handlers for the various GET and POST calls we need to support. This is where we interact with the database as well, getting information from the http requests we get, then crafting SQL queries to get or insert/update data in the DB.
        Reminder: The students in the class from the IS/IT department are required to submit their server file for grading. The digital marketing students can use files from IS/IT students for their testing
     The client side, which is everything the user interacts with. The students from digital marketing are required to submit these files for grading, though grading will take place through direct Teams discussions. This consists of three files:
        The main HTML file (contacts.html)
        The main JavaScript file (contacts.js)
        The CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) file (contacts.css)

I have given you all that you need to make this work in class. You have an HTML/Javascript client side set of files (NOTE: I did NOT give you the CSS file - that's fully up to you) that implements a form implementation that has all the functionality you'll need. You should get a server file (contactsserver.js) that you can use to set up your server. hat said, as I've said repeatedly in class - once you take all this code, it is yours, and you are fully responsible for it and MUST understand it all. 

I fully expect you to do lots of reading and looking things up to understand all the HTML elements, all the javascript - including the libraries being used like express, cors, JSON (body-parser), path, etc. There is quite a lot going on, and so you should expect to put in quality time to make sure you understand it all

My expectation is that you will actually modify the HTML/JavaScript client side files substantially to get the form that you want (including a CSS file that you'll create/edit to make it look how you want). While you can simply add a CSS file to change the look, I strongly encourage you to play with the form so that your contact application doesn't look (or behave) like everyone else's. If you don't make it yours, I will reduce your grade on the assignment. It doesn't take much to give me back what I already gave you - the point of this is that you learn how a typical web application works by taking code that works and making it yours. That said, you probably will not need to modify the server code at all - but you DO have to understand it.

You should include enough comments to make it very clear what you're doing. All indentation should be correct, and you should use the w3shools JavaScript style guide (Links to an external site.) and w3schools HTML style guide throughout for all variables and function names.  You should make use of functions to make the code easier to read and follow.

You will upload the 4 files that you have (client side HTML, JavaScript, and CSS + server side JavaScript). Please make sure you give me the JavaScript client-side file first, followed by the HTML and CSS client side and finally the server-side javascript file. That said, we will probably grade this through 1:1 or group presentations.
